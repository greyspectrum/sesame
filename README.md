# sesame

The simple password manager. 

(I'm still putting this together - the code is a bit of a mess and I'm in the middle of replacing the shell script elements with Python - so obviously don't try to use this yet.)

## Installation 

First, make the installation script executable:

`$ chmod +x install-sesame.sh`

Then, run it:

`$ ./install-sesame.sh`
